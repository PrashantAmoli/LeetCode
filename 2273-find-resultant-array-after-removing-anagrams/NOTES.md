For every we will put our first pointer at a string and second pointer at the next position of first pointer.
Keep on moving the second pointer by one step ahead if the string it is pointing is a anagram of string at first pointer.
If we found a string pointed by second pointer is not an anagram of string at first pointer then put string at first pointer in the answer array.
Instead of deleting words, we will skip it, this will save our time.
